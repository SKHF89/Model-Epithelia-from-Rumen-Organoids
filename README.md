# Model-Epithelia-from-Rumen-Organoids
Supplementary Materials for Rumen Epithelium Transcriptomic Analysis
This repository contains supplementary R scripts, visualizations, and result files used for the transcriptomic analysis of rumen epithelial samples, including:
FPKM filtering using zFPKM
DESeq2-based differential expression analysis
GO-based Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with pathway filtering
High-resolution Cnet plots of selected enriched pathways
Heatmaps of log2(FPKM) expression and z-score-normalized data
Pathway-grouped gene expression heatmaps
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots
Exported CSV files with gene-to-pathway mappings and expression metadata
The provided scripts are fully reproducible and tailored for multi-condition comparison (e.g., primary-insert vs tissue, organoid-insert vs tissue, and primary-insert vs organoid-insert).
